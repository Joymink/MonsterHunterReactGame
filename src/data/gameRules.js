This is an in person game to play with a minimum of 4 people.
This game is based off of the game SpyFall for a more thorough explaination.
You will put your name into the system and 
it will assign you a either human or monster. Once you see your assignment pay attention to your player number.
Name tags are recommended to play this game. Write your name and player number on that name tag.
Players that are assigned to Human make sure to read the player card, take note of the location and the example questions.
Remember only the humans know the location. So make sure when you are trying to figure out who the monsters are
to not give away what the exact location is.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For the monsters...
If you are assigned to monster make sure to take note who your team members are. Depending on how many monsters you select will determine the
amount of monsters on your team.
If you are the first monster assigned you will only see your name, but you will see which player numbers will be selected for the other monsters
so you will know who your monsters are regardless. Just make sure to take a mental note on what those numbers are.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The goal of the game is to win. After a set time that your group thinks the game should run for will detemine when the vote takes place.
At the end of the game all players (including monsters), will vote to who they think a monster is, you can either vote one monster out at a time,
or you can vote for all of them at the same time.
Who ever has the most votes gets casted out.
The player(s) casted out will tell the group if they are a monster or not.
If none of them are a monster. The monsters win.
If they are the monster they get one chance to tell the group what they think the secret location is.
If they answer what the correct secret location is the monsters win.
If they answer incorrectly the monsters lose.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ex. If there are 4 monsters and 2 of them get voted out, the monsters are in danger of losing.
If any of the 4 monsters guess the location correctly. The monsters win.
If none of them get it correct the humans win.
(This is different from spy fall).

If a majority of the monsters get voted out meaning half or more, the humans win as long as the monsters do
not know of the location.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How will you find out the location or find out who is a monster?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ASK QUESTIONS!
If you are a human you do not know who is a fellow human so ask thought provoking questions that could give you hints.
If the location is the beach you could ask "Do you feel like the location is usually warm or chilly?" if you are asking a human
they would most likely say "Pretty warm if you ask me."
If you ask a monster they will guess and say "I get chilly fast" and that would be a red flag for a human.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For a monster to find out the location they might ask a similar question and get hints based off of human answers.
They can also secretly converse with their fellow monsters and see what information they all collected.
But do not make it too obvious, a human might find it suspicious.
